            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h2>Honey</h2>
            <img width="400px" src="images/honey_main.jpeg" alt="Honey is a medium-sized golden retriever with honey brown fur. She has a white patch of fur on her chest and her right eye is smaller than her left">
            <p>Honeys favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the middle of January and half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my brother and I go underwater, she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we come up for air.</p>
            <p>While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase rocks. She will even chase rocks into the water and stick her whole face in the water to try and find the rock thrown. Chasing rocks is her main form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks from our house. If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey will go on a walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to walk from home. Finally one other Honey-ism is that her safe place is bathtubs. Many times our family has woken up in the middle of the night and found Honey is a bathtub</p>

            <h2>Jingle</h2>


            <img src="images/jingle.jpg" alt="Picture of Jingle" width="500">


            <p>Jingle is a domestic shorthair cat with a white chest and belly and a striped black and gray back. His
                paws are
                white and they look like mittens.
                Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get
                injured.
                Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes
                crazy
                and meows to go out.</p>

            <p>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside;
                a bee
                stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for
                four
                days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>
